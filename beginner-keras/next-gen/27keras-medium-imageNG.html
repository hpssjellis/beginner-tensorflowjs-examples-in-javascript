<h2 align=center>Convolutional Keras Layers Black and White Image Example!</h2>






<div style="font-size:15px; background-color:lightyellow; width:88%;  border:5px solid blue; padding:5px; margin:5px;"> 
Keras Single Digit Image using a Convolutional Layer<br><br>

 Working with black (1) and white (0) images is not much fun, so in this example RGB(50,150,250), 
 by the way that is the color blue, will be converted into single digit colors, losing some information but
 making things much easier to understand and and also to see the image as a chart of data.<br><br>
 
0: white<br>
1: black<br>
2: red<br>
3: orange<br>
4: yellow<br>
5: green<br>
6: blue<br>
7: indigo<br>
8: violet<br>
9: brown<br><br>
 
In this Convolutional Neural Network we will train the basic shapes:<br>
 no-shape, circles, triangles, rectangles. With only 4 outputs we can use one-hot vector encoding.<br><br>
