### A place to make a client side tfjs data management, display and model develop and classification site, similar to [teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) but on the client side.

Dec 2022

This github site is at 

https://github.com/hpssjellis/beginner-tensorflowjs-examples-in-javascript/edit/master/edge-tfjs/



Starting point called edge-tfj001.html is from https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/beginner-keras/28keras-full-image.html and is clunky and not very useable.

All other pages will have higher numbers.
