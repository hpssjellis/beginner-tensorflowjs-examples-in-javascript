A place to make a client side tfjs data load and present, model develop and use site, kind of like [teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) but on the client side.


Starting point called edge-tfj001.html is from https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/beginner-keras/28keras-full-image.html and is clunky and not very useable.

All other pages will have higher numbers. An index will be at https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/edge-tfjs/index.html

The latest version should always be at https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/edge-tfjs/edge-tfjs.html
