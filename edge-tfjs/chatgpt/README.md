https://hpssjellis.github.io/beginner-tensorflowjs-examples-in-javascript/edge-tfjs/chatgpt/tfjs.html

An index like this file will be at

I will list what I asked chatgpt and then you can see the code. The last stable version will be at the index.html link above.


1. [tfjs001.html](tfjs001.html)    for this thread write every answer as a single file html webpage with css and scripts in the same file. Put "my" in front of all variables and where appropriate use input tags for buttons and include the script in the button onclick handler. For now format the page.


3. [tfjs002.html](tfjs002.html)    update the above webpage to remove all css styling and make the button activates the webcam and puts the live image onto a canvas. The webcam should have a selection box to select for the front or rear camera.


5. [tfjs003.html](tfjs003.html)   
just write the code for an input type button to be added to the above code that the onclick stores the webcam image into an array to be inputed into a tensorflowjs model 



7. [tfjs004.html](tfjs004.html)
